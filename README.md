# About the Project:

`We are building a search algorithm/script to find potential employees who have recently updated online profiles (e.g. LinkedIn). This would basically align with a web crawler which traverses through links in the web and find potential employees who have recently updated profiles and are available in the market who would fit a given criteria.`
